Hello,

My name is Mr. Lam Jan the principal treasury officer with one of the prime=
 banks in Cote d=E2=80=99Ivoire. I have decided to contact you through this=
 medium based on a business proposal, which will be of mutual benefit to bo=
th of us. I discovered your email through comprehensive web email search on=
 directory so I decided to contact you. I know this might sound like scam t=
o you because of a lot of activities going on in the internet today. But I =
assure you that this is real.

I am the personal accounts manager to one of our late client, a national of=
 your country, who used to work with an oil servicing company here in Cote =
d=E2=80=99Ivoire, the late client made a numbered time (fixed) deposited fo=
r twelve calendar months, valued at =E2=82=AC8,200,000.00 (Eight Million Tw=
o Hundred Thousand European Euros) in my branch. Upon maturity, we sent a r=
outine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contra=
ct employers, PETRO-CI Corporation that my client died from an automobile a=
ccident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a will=
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made=
 further investigation and discovered that the deceased person did not decl=
are any next of kin in all his official documents, including his bank depos=
it paperwork.

This sum of (=E2=82=AC8,200,000.00) is still sitting in the bank and the in=
terest is rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No on=
e will come forward to claim it. According to the law of Cote d=E2=80=99Ivo=
ire, at the expiration of 5{five} years, the money will l revert to the own=
ership of the Cote d=E2=80=99Ivoire government if nobody claims the funds.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand i=
n as the next of kin to deceased person for the fact that you have same las=
t name with him so that this money will not be reverted by the government. =
If this request matches with your inward intention for success and greatnes=
s, then you are urged to make a quick response indicating your interest and=
 readiness to participate and work with me to make this successful.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transa=
ction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your =
assistance to invest my share in your country. In your return mail, please =
do forward your information as listed below if you are willing to complete =
this deal with me, to enable me put the total fund in your name for claim a=
s the next of kin to the deceased person:

Your full name:

Your contact address:

Your phone number:

Your age:


I wait for your urgent reply.

Regards,
Lam Jan
